The higher your blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled the greater the damage. heart attack or stroke (can cause atherosclerosis), Aneurysm (high pressure cause blood vessels to weaken and bulge,, forming an aneurysm it can rupture at any time), Heart Failure (high pressure causes thickened heart muscle and hard to pump blood to meet the body’s need), weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys (will prevent organs from functioning), thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes (this will cause vision loss), metabolic syndrome (increase waist circumference w/high insulin levels), trouble with memory or understanding.</p>
                    <p><b>High Blood Pressure:</b> (Primary Hypertension) is a medical condition where the force of blood rushes against the artery walls high enough that it can cause health problems such as heart disease. Typically develops over many years, it’s easily detected. Having high blood pressure uncontrolled increases the risk of severe health problems such as heart attack and even strokes.</p>
                    <p><b>Secondary Hypertension Symptoms:</b> (caused by underlying condition): Obstructive sleep apnea, Kidney problems, adrenal gland tumors, thyroid problems, blood vessels burn with congenital of all medications, illegal drugs (cocaine, amphetamines), certain defects in blood vessels you’re born with (congenital),certain medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs. Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, alcohol abuse or chronic alcohol use.</p>
                    <p><b>Causes of High Blood Pressure:</b> Physically inactive, overweight or obesity, using tobacco, alcohol (too much), sodium, potassium (too little), stress, chronic conditions, and pregnancy. Age, Race ( common in blacks also, stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure), Family History, Not being physically active, Using (Tobacco) damage the lining of your artery walls, (Secondhand smoke can increase your blood pressure). Too much salt (sodium) in your diet and cause the body to retain fluid increasing blood pressure. Too little potassium in your diet ( potassium balance the sodium in your cells not enough potassium will cause an accumulation of sodium in your blood. Too little vitamin D, this affects an enzyme produced by your kidneys that affects your blood pressure. Drinking too much alcohol overtime damages your heart. More than two a day for men or one a day woman will cause death. Stress do not eat more, or use tobacco, or drink alcohol. Certain chronic conditions: such as kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea will increase your blood pressure.</p>

                    <p><b>Early Stages of Low Blood Pressure:</b> Dizziness, Fainting (Syncope), tiredness or exhaustion, fainting, shortness of breath, general abdominal pain, cramps, or spasms, urinary tract infection symptoms, increased heartbeat, headache, rib pain, convulsions, loss of sensation, general weakness, general ill feeling, disordered motor function, nasal congestion, cough, leg pain, ache, soreness, or discomfort. Lack of concentration, Blurred vision, Cold, Clammy, Pale skin, Rapid, Shallow breathing, Fatigue, and Depression.</p>
                    <p><b>Chronically Low Blood Pressure:</b> Primary Hypotension is a dangerous condition where dehydration can sometimes cause blood pressure to drop. Dehydration does not automatically signal low blood pressure. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can all lead to dehydration. A potentially serious condition in which your body loses more water than you take in. Even mild dehydration (a loss of as little as 1% to 2% of body weight) can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Prolonged bed rest, Pregnancy, Certain Medications, Heart problems, Endocrine problems, Severe Infection (septic shock), Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), Neurally mediated hypotension, and Nutritional deficiencies.</p>
                    <p><b>Causes of Low Blood Pressure:</b> Prolonged bed rest, (Hypotension) Pregnancy (the first 24 weeks), Certain Medications (diuretics, erectile dysfunction drugs, nitroglycerine, narcotics and alcohol, other over the counter drugs if taken w/ high blood pressure medication) Heart problems (bradycardia, heart valves, Heart attack, and heart failure) Dehydration, Body losses more water then you can take in, mild dehydration causes weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise all leading to dehydration. Endocrine problems / Underactive Thyroid, Hypothyroidism or Hyperthyroidism, Parathyroid disease, Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease), Hypoglycemia low blood sugar (Diabetes),. Severe infection (Septicemia) or septic shock occurs when the bacteria leaves the site of infection going into the lungs, abdomen, or urinary tract entering the bloodstream. Bacteria produce toxins affecting blood vessels life-threatening decline levels. Severe Allergic Reaction penicillin, peanuts, insect venoms, latex, or bee or wasp stings. (Anaphylaxis) (Breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a sudden dramatic fall in blood pressure). Lack of Nutrients in diet/ insufficiency of vitamins B-12 and Folate can cause anemia. Heart Medications (Alpha Blockers, Beta Blockers, Diuretics, Antidepressants (tricyclic), Sildenafil (Viagra), (Dehydration)-Thirst, Dizziness or Lightheadedness, Fainting (syncope), Lack of concentration, Blurred Vision, Nausea, Cold, Clammy, Pale Skin, Rapid, shallow breathing, fatigue, & depression, Blood loss. Nutritional Deficiencies lacking essential vitamins B-12 and (Folate) folic acid can cause Anemia (body does not produce enough red blood cells), causing low blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><b>Orthostatic Hypotension:</b> Compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls when standing after sitting, occurs for a variety of reasons, common in older adults or health people after sitting for long periods in a squatting position. Leading Symptoms: Dizziness, Lightheadedness, Blurred vision and even Fainting. Symptoms: Dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders. Affects young people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after working for a time in a squatting position.</p>
                    <p><b>Postprandial Hypotension:</b> A sudden drop after eating causing affects older adults dizziness, faintness and falls. Gravity pulls blood to your feet when you stand, a large amount of blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat. It can also affect your autonomic nervous system disorders (Parkinson’s disease). Lowering the dose of blood pressure drugs and eating small, low-carbohydrate meals may help reduce symptoms.</p>
                    <p><b>Neurally Mediated Hypotension:</b> Mostly affects young people and it is faulty brain signals. This disorder causes blood pressure to drop after standing for long periods, leading to dizziness, nausea and fainting. This condition primarily affects young people and occurs from miscommunication between the heart and brain. Standing for extended hours causes your blood pressure to fall pooling in your legs. Nerves in the heart left ventricle actually signal the brain that blood pressure is too high, rather than to low. As a result, the brain lessens the heart rate, decreasing blood pressure. This causes more blood pool in the legs and less blood reaches the brain, leading to lightheadedness and fainting.</p>
                    <p><b>Multiple System Atrophy w/ Orthostatic Hypotension:</b> (Shy-Drager Syndrome) causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system damage. It controls involuntary functions like blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion to rise. It’s associated with Muscle tremors, slowed movement, problems with coordination and speech, and incontinence, severe to high blood pressure when lying down.</p>

It also provides the building blocks for healthy cells with anti-aging support and it comes in a convenient liquid, spray form. Metabolism of DNA and RNA has five nucleic acid bases make up the information code of life. Both DNA and RNA share three bases-adenine, guanine, and cytosine. In DNA the fourth base is thymine, whereas in RNA it is uracil. In DNA, each base combines with a five-carbon sugar call deoxyribose, hence the term DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. In RNA, each base combines with the five-carbon sugar ribose, thus RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. The information code in DNA in the cell nucleus is transcribed to RNA, which is then translated to all the enzymes and proteins made in the body. The DNA to RNA to protein translation mechanism makes possible the vast diversity of life on earth.</p>

                    <p><b>Fiber Soluble Fiber vs. Insoluble fiber:</b> both have important benefits. Soluble fiber helps to decrease blood glucose (blood sugar) levels and lowers blood cholesterol. Insoluble fiber: speeds up the passage of food through the digestive system. Regularity and prevent constipation, it also increases fecal bulk, which makes stools easier to pass. Also retains its shape while in the body.</p>
                    <p><b>Low Fiber Food Precautions:</b> Good for medical situations if undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. If your suffering from Crohn’s disease, Diverticulitis, Inflammatory bowel disease and Ulcerative colitis. Avoid high fiber foods if not this will cause the intestinal tract to work harder, so avoid spicy foods, fried foods, tough or processed meat, caffeine, cocoa from cocoa powder and nuts.</p>
                    <p><b>High Fiber Diet:</b> Reduce the risk of hemorrhoids and diverticulitis (small, painful pouches on the colon). Reduces amounts of LDL (bad) cholesterol. Reduce blood glucose (HbA1c) glycated hemoglobin can decrease with increased fiber. Reduce Cancer by naturally reacts with bacteria in the lower colon and can sometimes ferment into a chemical called butyrate, which may cause cancer cells to self-destruct. Longevity Reduce the risk of total mortality.</p>
                    <p><b>High Fiber Food Precautions:</b> Caffeine is a diuretic that causes loss of fluids, adding excess caffeine with a high fiber diet can cause constipation. Warning, do not attempt a do it yourself diet and you are mixing incorrect food combinations. This will lead to serious and very expensive health problems. In High Fiber Diets consumed to fast can cause bloating, cramps, and even diarrhea.</p>
                    <p><b>Fiber Supplements:</b> Not as good as raw fiber from whole foods, It’s good to regulate bowel movements, or suffering from constipation. They lower cholesterol and lowering blood sugar stabilization effects. Fiber supplements will interact with certain drugs, like aspirin, carbamazepine and warfarin, they also cause bloating and gas – just like the real thing.</p>
