                                <p>In November 2010, the American Public Health Association endorsed the health care home model as an important way that primary care may contribute to meeting the public health goals of increasing access to care, reducing health disparities, and better integrating health care with public health systems. Here we summarize the elements of the health care home (also called the medical home) model, evidence for its clinical and public health efficacy, and its place within the context of health care reform legislation. The model also has limitations, especially with regard to its degree of involvement with the communities in which care is delivered. Several actions could be undertaken to further develop, implement, and sustain the health care home.</p>

                                <p><b>THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH</b> Association (APHA) has 3 overarching policy priorities: rebuild the public health infrastructure, ensure access to care, and reduce health disparities.1,2 The health care home model contributes to these goals by improving health care delivery at the patient level through redesigning and expanding the scope of primary health care services and improving the interface between primary care practices and public health agencies.</p>
                                <p>In November 2010, APHA endorsed the health care home model of primary care for its public health value. <i>Health care home,</i> a term used by the National Association of Community Health Centers, is a model also referred to as the medical home.3,4 The health care home is a vehicle by which patient- and family-level care at the point of delivery may contribute to meeting population-level goals of improving access to care, reducing health disparities, increasing preventive service delivery, and improving chronic disease management.5 Here we summarize the APHA health care home policy statement and suggest next steps for moving the model forward.</p>
