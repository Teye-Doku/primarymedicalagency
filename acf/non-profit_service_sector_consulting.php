                                <p>ACNI experienced Executive Search team conducts industry-standard searches, using proprietary methods and original research to help nonprofits identify, recruit and hire highly qualified senior executives.</p>
                                <p>For an affordable fee, actually approximately half of what commercial search firms charge, ACNI can ensure that nonprofits fill their executive posts with top-flight and appropriate new leaders. Moreover, since ACNI, like its clients, is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, it well understands — much better than can a commercial search firm — a nonprofit client’s culture and operations.</p>
