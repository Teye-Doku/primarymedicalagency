                                <p>Certified Medical Professionals prove they have the necessary proficiency to perform all medical procedures in accordance with HIPPA Act regulations. Medical professionals are required to abide by an oath of “Do No Harm” and “Duty of Care” while upholding a certified career status as a medical professional. Also, once nationally certified, medical professionals are ready for hire and pay by the employment industry, and have a huge advantage over street-trained, uncertified medical persons.</p>
