                <p><b>PROCESSED FOODS</b> are engineered products. It’s mass-produced from batch to batch and country to country. It uses specialized ingredients that consists of pre-frozen macronutrients, stays emulsified (meaning it’s fat-based and water-based components stay mixed together, rather than separating), and has a long self or freezer life. <i>1. Processed Foods do not reflect a vast nutritional deficiency.</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Not enough fiber forms gelatinous which coats the intestinal walls.</b> Fiber is a plant-based nutrient it’s sometimes roughage or bulk. It is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be broken down tin digestible sugar molecules. The term “dietary fiber” refers to the indigestible parts of the plant-based foods. There are options that work to increase a healthier response in your diet.
                        <ul class="neul">
                            <li><strong>Benefits of Fiber:</strong> Digestion, Heart Health, Blood sugar regulation, cancer prevention, longevity, food allergies and asthma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fiber Soluble Fiber vs. Insoluble fiber:</strong> both have important benefits. Soluble fiber helps decrease blood glucose (blood sugar) levels and lowers blood cholesterol. Insoluble fiber: speeds up the passage of food through the digestive system. Regularity and prevent constipation, it also increases fecal bulk, which makes stools easier to pass. Also retains it’s shape while in the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Fiber Food Precautions:</strong> Good for medical situations if under going chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. If your suffering from Crohn’s disease, Diverticulitis, Inflammatory bowel disease and Ulcerative colitis. Avoid high fiber foods if not this will cause the intestinal tract to work harder, so avoid spicy foods, fried foods, tough or processed meat, caffeine, cocoa from cocoa powder and nuts.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Fiber Diet:</strong> Reduce the risk of hemorrhoids and diverticulitis (small, painful pouches on the colon). Reduces amounts of LDL (bad) cholesterol. Reduce blood glucose (HbA1c) glycated hemoglobin can decrease with increased fiber. Reduce Cancer by naturally reacts with bacteria in the lower colon and can sometimes ferment into a chemical called butyrate, which may cause cancer cell to self-destruct. Longevity Reduce the risk of total mortality.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Fiber Food Precautions:</strong> Caffeine is a diuretic that causes loss of fluids, adding excess caffeine with a high fiber diet can cause constipation. Warning, do not attempt a do it yourself diet and you are mixing incorrect food combinations. This will lead to serious and very expensive health problems. In High Fiber Diets consumed to fast can cause bloating, cramps, and even diarrhea.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fiber Supplements:</strong> Not as good as raw fiber from whole foods, It’s good to regulate bowel movements, or suffering from constipation. They lower cholesterol and lowering blood sugar stabilization effects. Fiber supplements will interact with certain drugs, like aspirin, carbamazepine and warfarin, they also cause bloating and gas —– just like the real thing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Not enough Omega-3 fatty acids (bottled drinks or canned fish meats)</strong> fish and nuts converts food into compounds docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid both have anti-inflammatory properties. Processed foods conversely, containing too much Omega-6 fatty acids. They are similar to Omega-3s. the compound is arachidonic acid. Omega-3 and-6 fatty acids should be one to one, in the U.S. 25 to one which is an pro-inflammatory state. This inflammation can cause Oxidative stress and damage to cells in the body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not enough micronutrients (supplements)</strong> containing few vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C and E, act as antioxidants, which help prevent cellular damage.</li>
                    <li><b>To many trans fats (Commercial Fried Foods)</b> the FDA passed regulation requiring companies to remove trans fats from their foods by 2018. The ingredients are still found in processed foods. Trans fat molecules are structurally different from other types of fats, such as omega-3 and -6 fatty acids. This difference means –a double bond found in the molecules- the human body is unable to break down trans fats. Instead the trans fats end up in a person’s arteries and liver, where they generate damaging free radical.</li>
                    <li><b>To many branched-chain amino acid. (Raw Meat)</b> Amino Acids are the building blocks of proteins. The “branched-chain” refers to a chemical structure of the amino acid including valine, leucine and isoleucine have branched-chains. The branched-chains are needed to build muscle, when a person eats too many of them. The excess molecules go to the liver, where they are converted into fat. Number one cause of over weight.</li>
                    <li><b>Emulsifiers (Ice creams)</b> are compounds that help keep fat and water from separating in foods these are high levels in processed foods. the compounds act as detergents, and they can strip away a type of mucus membrane that lines the intestines, protecting cells. this causes the risk of Intestinal disease or food allergies.</li>
                    <li><b>To many nitrates (Packaged Sandwich meat)</b> found in products such as cured meat, converted in the human body to compounds called nitrosourea, these compounds are linked to colon cancer.</li>
                    <li><b>To much salt (high sodium)</b> processed foods contain more salt than unprocessed foods. To much salt in the diet is linked to hypertension and heart disease.</li>
                    <li><b>To much Ethanol (grain alcohol)</b> this does not apply to processed foods, but to much ethanol, is a concern for adults. Ethanol converts in the human body into liver fat and also plays a role in oxidative stress. Drinking to much alcohol is lined to a number of diseases, including type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</li>
                    <li><b>To much fructose (fruit juices)</b> processed food contain high levels of fructose is a type of sugar that is broken down in the liver like ethanol. Sugar is referred to a the “alcohol of the child”. Many children today now have diseases linked to alcohol consumption, such as fatty liver disease based on the sugar consumption in children.</li>
